# X-Team NN Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks



## How will we track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
At meetings the team leader will have each member comment on what each of us has 
completed thus far and what is left to complete, this way we will all hold each other accountable. 

## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
If one person is struggling with their assignment they must communicate with the rest
of the group to resolve the issue promptly and effectively.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
